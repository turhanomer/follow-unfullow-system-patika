## Security Overview

The Stacks Follow System implements a decentralized social media platform with follow/unfollow functionality, reputation scoring, and privacy controls. Security is paramount as the system handles user relationships, reputation data, and privacy preferences.

### Key Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for all operations
3. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure by default configurations
4. **Complete Mediation**: All access attempts are validated
5. **Open Design**: Security through transparency

## Threat Model

### Attack Vectors

#### 1. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
- **Reentrancy Attacks**: Multiple contract calls in single transaction
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Mathematical operation errors
- **Access Control Bypass**: Unauthorized function execution
- **Logic Errors**: Incorrect business logic implementation

#### 2. User Privacy Attacks
- **Data Exposure**: Unauthorized access to private information
- **Privacy Bypass**: Circumventing privacy controls
- **Data Mining**: Aggregating user data for analysis
- **Social Engineering**: Manipulating users for information

#### 3. Reputation System Attacks
- **Sybil Attacks**: Creating multiple fake accounts
- **Reputation Manipulation**: Gaming the reputation system
- **Collusion**: Coordinated attacks on reputation scoring
- **Spam Attacks**: Mass following/unfollowing

#### 4. Economic Attacks

## Security Features

### 1. Access Control

#### Contract Owner Controls
```clarity
(define-constant CONTRACT_OWNER tx-sender)

(define-public (admin-function)
  (begin
    (asserts (eq? tx-sender CONTRACT_OWNER) ERR-UNAUTHORIZED)
    ;; Function logic
  )
)
```

#### User Authorization
```clarity
(define-public (user-specific-function)
  (begin
    (asserts (is-user-registered tx-sender) ERR-USER-NOT-FOUND)
    ;; Function logic
  )
)
```

### 2. Input Validation

#### Parameter Validation
```clarity
(define-public (register-user (username (string-ascii 50)))
  (begin
    (asserts (> (len username) 0) ERR-INVALID-INPUT)
    (asserts (<= (len username) 50) ERR-INVALID-INPUT)
    ;; Registration logic
  )
)
```

#### Type Safety
```clarity
(define-public (follow-user (target principal))
  (begin
    (asserts (is-user-registered target) ERR-USER-NOT-FOUND)
    (asserts (not (eq? tx-sender target)) ERR-CANNOT-FOLLOW-SELF)
    ;; Follow logic
  )
)
```

### 3. Rate Limiting

#### Action Rate Limiting
```clarity
(define-private (check-rate-limit (user principal))
  (let ((current-block (block-height))
        (rate-limit (map-get? rate-limits user)))
    (if (is-none rate-limit)
      (map-set rate-limits user (tuple current-block 1))
      (let ((last-block (get last-block (unwrap! rate-limit)))
            (action-count (get action-count (unwrap! rate-limit))))
        (if (>= (- current-block last-block) RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW)
          (map-set rate-limits user (tuple current-block 1))
          (if (>= action-count MAX_ACTIONS_PER_WINDOW)
            (ok ERR-RATE-LIMIT-EXCEEDED)
            (map-set rate-limits user (tuple last-block (+ action-count 1)))
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```

### 4. Privacy Controls

#### Privacy Levels
```clarity
(define-constant PRIVACY_LEVEL_PUBLIC 1)
(define-constant PRIVACY_LEVEL_FOLLOWERS_ONLY 2)
(define-constant PRIVACY_LEVEL_PRIVATE 3)

(define-private (can-access-content (requester principal) (target principal))
  (let ((target-settings (get-or-create-privacy-settings target))
        (privacy-level (get privacy-level target-settings)))
    (cond
      ((= privacy-level PRIVACY_LEVEL_PUBLIC) (true))
      ((= privacy-level PRIVACY_LEVEL_FOLLOWERS_ONLY) 
       (and (not (eq? requester target)) 
            (try! (contract-call? FOLLOW-SYSTEM-CONTRACT is-user-following requester target))))
      ((= privacy-level PRIVACY_LEVEL_PRIVATE) (eq? requester target))
      (true (false))
    )
  )
)
```

### 5. Reputation Protection

#### Reputation Validation
```clarity
(define-private (add-reputation-points (user principal) (points int) (reason (string-ascii 100)))
  (let ((current-reputation (get-or-create-reputation user))
        (current-score (get score current-reputation))
        (new-score (if (> points 0) (+ current-score points) (max 0 (- current-score (abs points))))))
    ;; Update reputation with bounds checking
    (map-set user-reputation user (tuple 
      new-score
      (calculate-tier new-score)
      (block-height)
      ;; ... other fields
    ))
  )
)
```

## Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. Reentrancy Protection

**Vulnerability**: Multiple contract calls in single transaction
**Mitigation**: State changes before external calls

```clarity
;; Secure pattern
(define-public (secure-function)
  (begin
    ;; Update state first
    (map-set data-map key new-value)
    ;; Then make external call
    (contract-call? external-contract external-function)
  )
)
```

### 2. Integer Overflow Protection

**Vulnerability**: Mathematical operation overflow
**Mitigation**: Bounds checking and safe operations

```clarity
;; Safe addition
(define-private (safe-add (a uint) (b uint))
  (if (> (+ a b) a)
    (+ a b)
    (ok ERR-OVERFLOW)
  )
)

;; Safe subtraction
(define-private (safe-sub (a uint) (b uint))
  (if (>= a b)
    (- a b)
    (ok ERR-UNDERFLOW)
  )
)
```

### 3. Access Control Validation

**Vulnerability**: Unauthorized function execution
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive authorization checks

```clarity
(define-public (sensitive-function (target principal))
  (begin
    ;; Check if user is registered
    (asserts (is-user-registered tx-sender) ERR-USER-NOT-FOUND)
    ;; Check if target is registered
    (asserts (is-user-registered target) ERR-USER-NOT-FOUND)
    ;; Check if user is not blocked
    (asserts (not (is-blocked tx-sender target)) ERR-USER-BLOCKED)
    ;; Check if target is not blocked
    (asserts (not (is-blocked target tx-sender)) ERR-USER-BLOCKED)
    ;; Function logic
  )
)
```

### 4. Privacy Bypass Protection

**Vulnerability**: Circumventing privacy controls
**Mitigation**: Multi-layer privacy validation

```clarity
(define-private (validate-privacy-access (requester principal) (target principal))
  (begin
    ;; Check blacklist first (highest priority)
    (if (is-blacklisted requester target)
      (false)
      ;; Check whitelist
      (if (is-whitelisted requester target)
        (true)
        ;; Check privacy level
        (can-access-content requester target)
      )
    )
  )
)
```
